 # JWT Authentication System

This code implements a JWT-based authentication system for a Node.js application. It includes functionality for user signup, login, password reset, and password update. The code is well-structured and uses industry-standard practices for authentication and security.

## Key Features

- **JWT-based authentication**: Utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication.
- **Password hashing**: Employs bcrypt for hashing user passwords, ensuring secure storage.
- **Password reset**: Allows users to reset their passwords through a secure token-based mechanism.
- **Role-based access control**: Provides the ability to restrict access to certain routes based on user roles.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. User Signup

The `signup` function handles user registration. It creates a new user in the database and sends a JWT to the user.

```javascript
exports.signup = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  const newUser = await User.create({
    name: req.body.name,
    email: req.body.email,
    password: req.body.password,
    passwordConfirm: req.body.passwordConfirm,
  });

  createSendToken(newUser, 201, res);
});
```

### 2. User Login

The `login` function authenticates a user by checking their email and password. If the credentials are correct, it sends a JWT to the user.

```javascript
exports.login = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  if (!email || !password)
    return next(new AppError('input email or password', 401));

  const user = await User.findOne({ email }).select('+password');

  if (!user || !(await user.correctPassword(password, user.password))) {
    return next(new AppError('email or password is incorrect!', 401));
  }

  createSendToken(user, 200, res);
});
```

### 3. JWT Protection

The `protect` function is a middleware that protects routes by ensuring that a valid JWT is present in the request.

```javascript
exports.protect = catchAsync(async (req, res, next) => {
  let token;
